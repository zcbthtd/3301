This folder contains all scripts used for data analysis carried out during the BIOC3301 metagenomic analysis project

Core diversity analyses (generating OTU tables, rarefaction curves, PCoA plots) was carried out for 2018 data.
Further similar analyses were carried out for 2016 and 2017 data.

Further analyses carried out using 2018 data:
core micrbiome
2d plots
compare categories (ANOSIM)
group significance


fiter taxa from otu table?
observation metadata correlation?
make otu heatmap?
plot taxa summary?
compare alpha diversity?
summarize taxa through plots?
jackknifed beta diversity?
compare distance matrices?
