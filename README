README file describing scripts written and used for BIOC3301 metagenomic analysis project.
Analysis pipeline is described in brief below.
Subheadings (e.g. --- 2018, etc.) describe which dataset was used for each section of the analysis.
Reference no. (e.g. 1.1.) identifies script use, with brief explanation of its function.

                                               between the OTU abundance with respect to pH/N/P/K.
1.6. filter_taxa_from_otu_table.pbs         :  OTU table data filtered to generate OTU table with
                                               Adidobacteria only.

2.2. compare_categories_acido.pbs           :  ANOSIM used to assess significance of change in
                                               Acidobacteria class-composition with respect to
                                               pH/N/P/K.
2.3. group_significance_acido.pbs           :  assessment of statistically significant differences
                                               in Acidbacteria class abundance with respect to
                                               pH/N/P/K.
